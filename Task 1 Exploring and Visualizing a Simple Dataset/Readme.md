# Iris Dataset Analysis 🌸📊

This repository contains a Python script for analyzing the Iris dataset using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The script generates visualizations to explore the dataset's features and relationships.

## Overview ℹ️

The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in machine learning, containing measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for three species of iris flowers: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.

## Features ✨

- **Dataset Exploration**: Displays the first few rows, shape, information, and descriptive statistics of the Iris dataset.
- **Pairplot Visualization**: Creates a pairplot to show relationships between features, colored by species.
- **Histograms**: Generates histograms for each feature, segmented by species.
- **Boxplots**: Produces boxplots to visualize the distribution and spread of each feature by species.

## Requirements 🛠️

To run the script, you need the following Python libraries:

- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`

Install them using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage 🚀

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/iris-analysis.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd iris-analysis
   ```
3. Run the Python script:
   ```bash
   python iris_analysis.py
   ```

## Visualizations 📈

The script generates three types of plots:
- **Pairplot**: Scatter plots showing pairwise relationships between features, with points colored by species.
- **Histograms**: Distributions of each feature (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width) for each species.
- **Boxplots**: Boxplots showing the spread and outliers of each feature, grouped by species.
